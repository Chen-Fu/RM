Question 5
Suppose that we have created a machine learning algorithm that predicts whether a link 
will be clicked with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity. The rate the link is clicked 
is 1/1000 of visits to a website. If we predict the link will be clicked on a specific 
visit, what is the probability it will actually be clicked?

sol.
      predict\real     +         -
           +          TP        FP
           -          FN        TN
TP:true positive
FP:false positive
TN:true negatice
FN:false negative

99% sensitivity and 99% specificity
=> 0.99 = TP/(TP+FN)
   0.99 = TN/(FP+TN)

The rate the link is clicked is 1/1000 of visits to a website
=> TP + FN = 0.001, FP + TN = 1 - (TP + FN) = 0.999
=> TP = 0.99*0.001, FN = 0.01*0.001, TN = 0.999*0.99, FP = 0.999*0.01

What is the probability it will actually be clicked?
=> probability it will actually be clicked = TP/(TP+FP) = 11/122
